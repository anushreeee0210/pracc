//1st way is from terminal which u know has linux and 2nd is from direct botton
staging area is a area where ur code is sent before sending to github or online or to others

terminal way:- (stepwise)
1. git add . (to add current file and inside folder of that directory only)   OR 
2. git add --all  or git add -A  (This will select and put all the file inside that project in staging area)
3. git commit -m "your msg"   (this will finalize ur code from staging area so it can be sent online ie github)
4. git push   (this will put ur code from ur file to online ie github )

for example:- for now what we have created? which are notin github?? we dont have readme wala uploaded rigfht?
