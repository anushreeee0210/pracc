staging area is a area where ur code is sent before sending to github or online or to others

terminal way:- (stepwise)
1. git add . (to add current file and inside folder of that directory only)   OR 
2. git add --all  or git add -A  (This will select and put all the file inside that project in staging area)
3. git commit -m "your msg"   (this will finalize ur code from staging area so it can be sent online ie github)
4. git push   (this will put ur code from ur file to online ie github )

for example:- for now what we have created? which are notin github?? we dont have readme wala uploaded rigfht?

intellj button:-

1. just commit adn psuh wala tap karna hota hai
2. kabi kabi error deta hai toh bar bar tap karna hota hai lol
3. but the thing is yaha se push ya kuch bhi karte haina toh vo error q aaya find out karne mein dikkat hota hai islia terimnal one is recommended qki wahabata dete hai error ky hai
